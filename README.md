# Art Store

[Art](https://.herokuapp.com/) is a React web store designed to sell all things Art related. Inspired by my little sister, who is an artist, Mias Art store is an ecommerce store for hand painted art and supplies. Like any store, you can browse by catergory and add things to your cart for checkout.
